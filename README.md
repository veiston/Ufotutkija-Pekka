## Start the Server and Interface

1. Navigate to the `Source` directory:
   ```sh
   cd Source
   ```

2. Launch the server:
   ```sh
   python server.py
   ```

3. Open your browser and go to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: Unknown collation: 'utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci'

If you encounter the following error when running the application:

```
mysql.connector.errors.DatabaseError: 1273 (HY000): Unknown collation: 'utf8mb4_0900_ai_ci'
```

This error occurs because MySQL does not support the specified collation.

### Solution

In the `database.py` file, inside the `connect_to_database` function, uncomment the following line:

```python
collation = 'utf8mb3_unicode_ci'  # I think this breaks the database on Windows
```

This change ensures compatibility with your MySQL version.
